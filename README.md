# ReasonML Playground

[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) playground with a set of tiny projects so that anyone can learn the language quickly by example.

## Prerequisites

* Install [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/quickstart-javascript.html) following instructions on the website
* Install [Global Binaries](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/global-installation.html) that make IDE plugins work
* Finally, install [IDE Plugins](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/editor-plugins.html) so you benefit from the full IDE support whilst writing Reason code


## Installing dependencies & compiling the code

* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
* Run `npm run start` to compile the code and continuously rebuild as you change the code
* Or run `npm run build` to compile code once

## Troubleshooting

If the code does not compile try uninstalling `bs-platform` and `reason-cli` first and then follow the installation guides above

```
npm uninstall -g bs-platform reason-cli
```

## The repository

This repository is meant to be a playground so that everybody can learn the language, break things, change things or even improve the examples.

Feel free to create pull requests if you find these examples useful. Also, please let me know if you find them too easy or too complex.
