## Prerequisites

* Install [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/quickstart-javascript.html) following instructions on the website
* Install [Global Binaries](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/global-installation.html) that make IDE plugins work
* Finally, install [IDE Plugins](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/editor-plugins.html) so you benefit from the full IDE support whilst writing Reason code


## Installing dependencies & compiling the code

* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
* Run `npm run start` to compile the code and continuously rebuild as the code changes
* Open `http://localhost:1234` to see the running application

## Troubleshooting

If the code does not compile try uninstalling `bs-platform` and `reason-cli` first and then follow the installation guides above

```
npm uninstall -g bs-platform reason-cli
```

## The repository

This repository is meant to be a playground so that everybody can learn the language, break things, change things or even improve the examples.
